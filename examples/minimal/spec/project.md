# Python Basics Workshop - Project Context

## Storyline

This workshop introduces Python programming through hands-on exercises.
Participants start with basic syntax and progress to data structures,
building confidence through incremental challenges.

## Learning Approach

- **Interactive**: Immediate feedback through coding exercises
- **Progressive**: Each module builds on previous knowledge
- **Practical**: Real-world examples and use cases

## Key Outcomes

By the end, participants will:
- Write simple Python programs independently
- Choose appropriate data structures for tasks
- Debug common errors with confidence
